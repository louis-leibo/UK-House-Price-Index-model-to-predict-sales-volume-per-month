# UK House Price Index: model to predict the sales volume per month in the UK

I have applied applied computer programming to modify data and fit and apply linear regression models for making predictions. 

Using the government data set on the House Price Index in the UK, I create a linear model to predict the sales volume per month in the UK. 
I then evaluate how well my model fits the data and how well my model predicts the future and conclude by explaining my choices. 

Please find explanations of the code and the code in the Quarto mardown and the code in the R script.
